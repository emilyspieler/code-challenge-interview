thanks for checking out my application! It was a pleasure to show you my 1.5 hour coding abilities.

this is an app made from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you wish to view locally:
1. download the file onto your desktop
2. open the index.js file directly on your web browser.
3. view file to see features of the app

this is a "game of life" game which will have clickable game pieces in a chart as well as a stop and start button.
